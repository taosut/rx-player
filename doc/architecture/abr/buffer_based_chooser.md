[BOLA Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06748.pdf) finds optimal quality
value to minimize playback buffering and maximize buffered quality.

[1]Â BOLA broadly defines minimum buffer steps for which we can allow to download
a quality:

                                 Buffer gap (s)
```

[2] The BOLA estimation is computed each time a segment is appended (thus buffer
gap is updated).

The RxPlayer has a mecanism that allows to replace buffered segments when newly
estimated quality is upper. That leads to buffer gap not increasing when a chunk
is added. That could mislead BOLA, and cause oscillations between chosen
qualities.

[3] In order to avoid this trend, we compute a maintanability score for currently 
downloaded quality. It is an [EWMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWMA) of the
ratio between segment duration and segment download time. If the score points
that a quality is "maintanable", the BOLA algorithm is "allowed" to pick an
upper quality. Conversely, when a quality may not be downloadable fast enough,
the BOLA is "allowed" to decrease the estimated quality.

If no maintanability score is computed, then BOLA works in a normal way.
